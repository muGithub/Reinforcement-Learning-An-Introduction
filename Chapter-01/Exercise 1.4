Good idea!
1.We should set a threshhold to control when player tend to explore, when don't.
2.It's depended on what kind of games we played, and how many experience we have. if we have much prior experience and the game is not suit for exploring, then the first would be better.

Now, talk something about my view, this way that the step-size parameter is appropriately reduced over time would increase the probability of exploration!
